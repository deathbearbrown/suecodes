    <p>I'm Sue. I am a big fan of appreciating bad art in all it's forms.  Also some good art, I guess, though I mostly make the bad kind.</p>

    <p>I like making things, which why I've become interested in hardware. In particular, robot arms that can poke cats and tiny buzzers that can be programmed to make sounds that annoy cats. Side note: I'm more of a dog person than a cat person.</p>

    <p>I work at a place called <a href="http://bocoup.com">Bocoup</a>, which is totally not a cult. There I make applications with javascript, php, python, whatevs and try to help clients do a good internet.</p>
